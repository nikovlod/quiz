‡¶Ü‡¶∞‡ßá, ‡¶ö‡¶Æ‡ßé‡¶ï‡¶æ‡¶∞ ‡¶™‡ßç‡¶∞‡¶∂‡ßç‡¶®! Differentiating these vascular patterns is crucial for recognizing underlying pathology, often pointing straight to systemic diseases. As a diligent Med student (‡¶π‡¶∞‡¶ø‡¶¨‡ßã‡¶≤ here!), I've synthesized the key distinctions for you, focusing on morphology, blanching, and etiology.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Livedo Reticularis

Livedo Reticularis describes a mottled or rete (netlike) appearance on localized areas of the extremities, manifesting as reddish-to-blue discoloration.

| Feature | Description & Vital Points |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Morphology** | A mottled reticular vascular pattern that appears as a lace-like, purplish discoloration of the skin. |
| **Mechanism** | Caused by slowed blood flow through the superficial horizontal venous plexus. It represents localized vasodilatation. |
| **Blanching** | **Blanches with pressure** (Diascopy is key here!). |
| **Types** | **Primary/Idiopathic:** Typically benign, symmetric, and uniform mottling, often more prominent with cold exposure and improving upon warming. |
| **Associations (Secondary)** | Can be associated with vasculitides, atheroembolism, hyperviscosity, cryoglobulinemia, Sneddon's syndrome, and Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS). It is also seen with purpuric lesions and painful ulcerations in livedoid vasculopathy. |

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Livedo Racemosa

Livedo Racemosa is essentially a specific, irregular form of secondary livedo reticularis.

| Feature | Description & Vital Points |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Morphology** | Characterized by a **broken, irregular, and asymmetric pattern**. The mottling is irregular and disrupted. |
| **Blanching** | Unlike the benign form of livedo reticularis, the mottling generally **does not improve with warming**. (Since it's a form of livedo, it should blanch, but the sources emphasize its irregularity and non-improvement with heat, differentiating it clinically from primary livedo reticularis). |
| **Significance** | It is the term used to characterize **secondary livedo reticularis**. |
| **Associations** | It is a microvascular feature recognized in the clinical domain of Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS). |

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Retiform Purpura

Retiform Purpura is not a single diagnosis, but a configuration of non-inflammatory purpura associated with vascular occlusion or thrombi formation.

| Feature | Description & Vital Points |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Morphology** | Purpuric lesions that display a **retiform configuration** (net-like pattern). This morphology indicates thrombi formation within the vessels and subsequent cutaneous infarcts. |
| **Blanching** | Purpura results from extravasation of red blood cells into the dermis, meaning the lesions **do not blanch with pressure** (non-palpable or palpable purpura). |
| **Mechanism** | Associated with thrombi formation within vessels, distinguishing them from non-inflammatory purpura caused by clotting defects or vascular fragility. Embolic lesions often have an **irregular outline**, indicative of a cutaneous infarct. |
| **Etiologies** | The non-inflammatory purpura with a retiform configuration is seen in conditions causing vessel thrombosis, including Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC), monoclonal cryoglobulinemia, thrombocytosis, Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP), Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome, and reactions to warfarin and heparin (HIT). |

### üìù Key Differential Points to Remember:

1.  **Blanching:** The most critical distinction! **Livedo reticularis** is due to altered flow (blanchable), whereas **Retiform purpura** is due to vascular occlusion/extravasation (non-blanchable purpura).
2.  **Configuration & Severity:** While both Livedo reticularis and Livedo racemosa involve a net-like pattern, the latter is **irregular and disrupted**. Retiform purpura usually signals a severe underlying thrombotic process leading to **hemorrhagic infarcts**.
3.  **Pathophysiology:** Livedo reticularis is a vascular phenomenon (slowed flow/vasospasm), while Retiform purpura is a purpuric event caused by **vessel thrombi/occlusion**.
