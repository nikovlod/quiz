      "question": "A 32-year-old woman is brought to the Emergency department by the police. She was found preaching outs ide the local supermarket, telling people that she is god's disciple and has been sent to prevent them from wasting money. It transpires that she has also spent up to her limit on her bank card. She began treatment with fluoxetine some 3 weeks ago for reactive depression after splitting from her husband. A limited physical examination due to poor compliance is unremarkable, as is a routine blood screen.\nWhich of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
      "options": [
        "Mania",
        "Psychotic depression ",
        "Munchausen's syndrome",
        "Schizophrenia"
      ],
      "answer": "Mania",
      "explanation": "Key features here include clear evidence of delusions of grandeur, coupled with starting treatment for fluoxetine some 3 weeks ago. Taken together these factors suggest possible mania. it is most likely to be related to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor prescription for her depression.\n\nPsychotic depression is unl ikely given there are no delusions related to ill ness, loss of selfworth o r other features usual ly expected. Schizophrenia is also unlikely given the absence of features such as auditory hallucinations or delusions of reference. Rather than being associated with agitation and hyperactivity, drowsiness and memory loss are more common featu res of viral encephalitis. The proximity to fluoxetine prescription, and the fact features of her illness fit so well with mania, make Munchausen's syndrome unlikely."

      "question": "A 34-year-old male comes to clinic for an asthma review. He tells you he has recently been diagnosed with a personality disorder. The diagnosis came about after he was referred by his boss to occupational health for being overly sensitive and getting angry when colleagues told him how to do his job.

      "answer": "Paranoid personality disorder",
      "explanation": "The correct answer is paranoid personality disorder. Patients with paranoid personality disorder are over sensitive, unforgiving and perceive feedback as attacks on their character. They can be preoccupied with conspiracy theories and tend to question the loyalty of others. Based on the patients' description, this is the most likely diagnosis.\n\nOption 1 is incorrect. Patients with schizoid personality disorder tend to have a lack of interest in sexual interactions are cold and lack close friendships preferring to spend time alone. They are also indiffe rent to praise making this unlikely to be the correct answer.\n\nNarcissistic personality disorder is not the correct answer. These patients have a heightened impression of self-importance and entitlement often believing they have unlimited abilities to succeed, become powerful or look beautiful. Additionally, they lack empathy and will happily take advantage of others to achieve their own need.\n\nBorderline personality disorder is also incorrect. This is characterised by emotional instability, impulsive behaviour, feelings of emptiness and recurrent attempts at self-harm. Patients often fear abandonment as opposed to the questioning loyalty of those around them.\nPatients with avoidant personal ity disorder tend to avoid social contact/relationships due to fear of being criticised, rejected or embarrassed as opposed to being unforgiving, making this less likely the correct answer."
